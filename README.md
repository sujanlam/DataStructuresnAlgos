Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Problems and Solutions repository! This repository contains a collection of problems and solutions related to various data structures and algorithms, all implemented in Java. 
It is designed to help you improve your coding skills and understanding of fundamental computer science concepts. Each problem includes a detailed description, sample input and output, and a well-explained solution with complexity analysis. 
The repository is organized into folders by data structure or algorithm type. Contributions are welcome and can be made by adding new problems or improving existing solutions. 
This resource is ideal for students preparing for technical interviews, coding competitions, and academic exams.
